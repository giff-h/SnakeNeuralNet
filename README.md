# Snake Neural Net

This is a project to teach myself neural nets and machine learning,
using the classic game Snake.

I'll start with a standard 20x20 area, random food placement, and
eventually make a random size area as well.

Funny side note, there is an Android game called 'Python' that is the
game Snake. No, the fact that I'm initially coding this in Python is not
lost on me.
